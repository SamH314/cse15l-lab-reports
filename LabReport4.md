`<up> <up> <enter> ` 

I clicked the up arrow two times to access my previous commands and pressed enter as soon as I saw `ssh cs15lfa23ek@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, as to login into a remote server in the CSE computer lab.

I typed the command `cd lab7 <enter>` to change my current directory to lab7. Then I typed the command `ls lab7 <enter>` in order to see the contents of the current directory. Then I typed  `bash test.sh <enter>` in order to run the bash script that compiles and runs  `ListExamples.java ListExamplesTests.java` which ran the test that demonstrated the errors.

I typed the command `vim ListExamples.java <enter>` in order to edit `ListExamples.java` file. I then typed `<shift> ; 44` to go to line 44 where the error seems to be. I clicked `l` 6 times in order to get to the index number I need to change, to make index1 become index2. I clicked `i` to get into insert mode and hit `<delete> 2 <escape>` to make the change and escape out of insert mode. To save the change and quit out of vim I typed the command  `:wq <enter>`

Being back in the terminal, I ran  `bash test.sh` in order to run the test and show that they succeed.
